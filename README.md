## Super Store Sales Dashboard and 15 Days Forecasting Project

### Situation/Objective
Our Super Store was experiencing challenges in understanding sales performance and predicting future sales trends. The existing reports were not providing comprehensive insights into various aspects of sales, such as product categories, regions, shipping modes, and customer segments. Additionally, there was a need to forecast sales for better inventory and resource management.

### Task

1. **Visualize sales data** by category, sub-category, region, state, segment, ship mode, and payment mode.
2. **Analyze profitability** over different time periods and geographical areas.
3. **Forecast sales for the next 15 days** to aid in planning and decision-making.

### Action

#### Data Collection and Preparation
